In the layout the elements are not arranged on the grid and since the task did not say that pixel perfect layout is required, the layout is made with elements arranged on the grid. 
Layouts for desktop and mobile versions are also not available, the layout for these sizes was made approximate and may be slightly different from expectations. 


### Technical stack
- SCSS
- HTML

### The layout is adaptive for multiple screen sizes: 
- 1 600px (original layout)
